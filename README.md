###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Z-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Z-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Z-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Complete-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Complete-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Complete-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT
X-AXIS ASSEMBLY:

SMOOTH ROD:

Smooth rods are typically used to support and guide the print head and print bed as they move.

BEARING:

Bearings allow things to spin freely while fixed structurally in place using bearings with your 3D prints is actually really simple

IDLER:

An idler wheel to push the filament into the teeth of the drive wheel. An idler wheel usually is a round bearing pushed by a spring or a rubber bushing.
Y-AXIS ASSEMBLY.

EXTRUDER:

An extruder ejects material in liquid or semi-liquid form in order to deposit it in successive layers within the 3D printing volume.

MOTOR:

Motors are used to move the extruder or the build platform alone the x, y, and z axis.

Y-AXIS ASSEMBLY:

 Y-AXIS SUPPORTER:

The Y axis supporter on a printer support the movement in forward and backward.
 
HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL THREADED RODS:
 
 Threaded rod is commonly used to connect two objects together, such as wood or metal, or to provide a connection between concrete and another material.
 
 SMOOTH ROD:
 
 Smooth rods are typically used to support and guide the print head and print bed as they move.
 
 PULLEY:
 
 A 3D printer pulley is a small mechanical device used to help guide and position the print head.

MOTOR:
 
 Motors are used to move the extruder or the build platform alone the x, y, and z axis.
 
 Y-AXIS FRAME:

The Y-axis frame refers to the structural component of a 3D printer that supports and guides the movement of the print bed or build plate along the Y-axis.

Y-AXIS BASE:

The Y-axis base in 3D printing refers to the foundational component of a 3D printer that provides support and stability for the Y-axis movement.

 Z-AXIS ASSEMBLY:

Z-AXIS ROD:

The Z-axis rod is used to control the vertical movement of the print head or the print bed during the printing process.

Z-AXIS TOP COVER:

The Z-axis top cover refers to a protective or enclosing component that is positioned at the uppermost part of the Z-axis assembly or structure in a 3D printer.

MOTOR:

Motors are used to move the extruder or the build platform alone the x, y, and z axis.
